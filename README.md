# repo-git

This is my first remote repository that includes HTML files. I used basic git commands to push from my local machine to GitHub using git bash only.

## Description

This repository contains HTML files demonstrating my initial experience with Git and GitHub. The primary objective is to practice and understand the basic git operations.

## Installation

To clone this repository to your local machine, run the following command:
